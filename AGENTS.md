  - Mandates one step/one tool, always include a preamble, maintain `reasoning_effort`, and limit context gathering to â‰¤2 commands for small tasks (`agent/rules/agentic-tools.md:40`).
  - V4A rules for `apply_patch`: edit one file per call, â‰¥3 context lines, use relative paths, and split unrelated hunks (`agent/rules/agentic-tools.md:75`).
