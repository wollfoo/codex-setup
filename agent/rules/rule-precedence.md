# RULE PRECEDENCE – Conflict Resolution

<codex_cli_core>
<rule_precedence>

## Objective & Scope
- Objective: Provide a deterministic, safe, and efficient way to resolve contradictory instructions across sources.
- Scope: Applies to all instructions and artifacts (system/developer/agents/domain), tool usage rules, workflows, and documentation in `rules/` and `.windsurf/rules/`.

## Order of Precedence
1) System
2) Developer
3) AGENTS (workspace rules, workflows)
4) Domain (product/app-specific rules)

Notes:
- Higher level always overrides lower level when conflicts exist.
- Domain rules apply only when they do not conflict with AGENTS/Developer/System.
- If a rule requires a different language/format, follow the higher-level instruction (typically Developer), otherwise default to language/format rules.

## Execution Directives (delta)
- Inherit global directives from `rules/global-rules.md` (instruction hierarchy, sequential-only tool execution, evidence citation, low tool budget for small tasks).
- Deltas for precedence handling:
  - Evaluate precedence before acting when signals conflict; do not average contradictory instructions.
  - Select the highest-priority instruction and briefly note the rationale in the tool preamble when deviating from a lower-level rule.
  - If the higher-level instruction is ambiguous, apply tie-breakers below and proceed using the escape-hatch policy (execute smallest safe step and document).

## Conflict Resolution Process
1) Identify conflict: quote or reference the conflicting lines; cite `file:line` when applicable.
2) Apply precedence: choose the higher-level instruction (System › Developer › AGENTS › Domain).
3) Safety gate: validate against `rules/environment-profile.md` (safe vs unsafe; Windows PowerShell specifics).
4) Minimal compliant action: execute the smallest correct step consistent with precedence and `sequential-only`.
5) Document briefly: include a one-line rationale in the tool preamble; if uncertainty remains after one minimal check, proceed under the escape hatch.

## Tie-breakers (same-level conflicts)
- Specificity: the more specific instruction (file- or function-scoped) overrides a general one within the same level.
- Safety first: prefer the instruction that reduces risk (e.g., read-only vs mutating) when equally specific.
- Determinism: prefer instructions with explicit thresholds/constraints (e.g., tool budget) over vague guidance.
- Recency (if explicitly versioned/dated): prefer the newer instruction within the same level.

## Language & Formatting
- Follow `rules/language-rules.md` and `rules/markdown-formatting.md` unless a higher-level instruction overrides them.
- When language/format directives conflict, apply the Order of Precedence and document deviations in the tool preamble.

## Examples (Good/Bad)
- Good (language conflict): System says “Vietnamese-only” while a Domain doc says “English”. Outcome: respond in Vietnamese (higher level: System). Briefly note precedence if needed.
- Good (tool execution): Developer mandates sequential-only tool calls; a Domain guideline suggests parallel search. Outcome: execute sequential-only (higher level: Developer).
- Bad: “Blend” both by running some calls sequentially and some in parallel without rationale.
- Bad: Ask the user to resolve a trivial conflict that can be decided by precedence.

## Success Metrics
- 0 unresolved conflicts in the final plan/action.
- Actions comply with precedence, `sequential-only`, and small-task tool budgets (≤ 2 unless justified).
- Evidence-first: `file:line` citations when referencing repo artifacts.
- Brief rationale emitted when overriding a lower-level rule.

## Anti-patterns
- Ignoring higher-level instructions due to convenience or habit.
- Merging contradictory instructions into a compromised behavior.
- Over-escalating to the user when precedence suffices to decide.
- Violating sequential-only or tool budgets to satisfy both sides of a conflict.

## Decision Checklist
- Which instructions conflict, and where (files/lines)?
- Which one is higher by the Order of Precedence?
- Do safety constraints alter the decision?
- What is the smallest compliant next action?

## Consistency & Precedence
- Follow: `rules/global-rules.md` (hierarchy, sequential-only, evidence).
- Align: `rules/environment-profile.md` (safe vs unsafe actions; Windows specifics).
- Align: `rules/language-rules.md`, `rules/markdown-formatting.md` (output expectations).
- Align: `rules/context-gathering.md`, `rules/context-understanding.md` (low budget, early stop, escape hatch).
- Align: `rules/reasoning-effort.md` (choose effort level; preambles; minimal reasoning guidance).
- Align: `rules/persistence.md` (no early handback; complete to the end).
- Align: `rules/memory_tool_usage_guide.md` (disciplined search/store; evidence-first).
